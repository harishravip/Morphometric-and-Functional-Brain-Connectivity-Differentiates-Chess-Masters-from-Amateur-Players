# Morphometric-and-Functional-Brain-Connectivity-Differentiates-Chess-Masters-from-Amateur-Players
Official implementation of the paper "Morphometric and Functional Brain Connectivity Differentiates Chess Masters from Amateur Players"

The datasets analyzed for this study can be found in the 1000 Functional Connectomes Project (http://fcon_1000.projects.nitrc.org/indi/pro/wchsu_li_index.html).

Functional MRI data is preprocessed using AFNI (Cox, Robert W. "AFNI: software for analysis and visualization of functional magnetic resonance neuroimages." Computers and Biomedical research 29.3 (1996): 162-173.)
Anatomical MRI data is preprocessed using Freesurfer (Fischl, Bruce. "FreeSurfer." Neuroimage 62.2 (2012): 774-781.)

The following python packages are required to run the code:
numpy
scipy
pandas
